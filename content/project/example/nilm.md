Joined A/Prof. Du's lab to work on a non-intrusive electricity load monitoring (NILM) project predicting the electric vehicles' electricity usage from the waveform graph of households.

Finished data cleaning and reproduced the AFHMM and machine learning Benchmarks.

Designed a semi-supervised deep learning algorithm to solve the problem.
